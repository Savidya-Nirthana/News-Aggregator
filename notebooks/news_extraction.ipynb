      "The agreement, which leaders said would meet Ukraine's military and economic needs for the next two years, came after more than a day of talks at a summit in Brussels. \n",

      "\"We committed, we delivered,\" EU chief Antonio Costa wrote on X as he announced the deal to provide a loan backed by the bloc's common budget. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had urged leaders to use €200bn of frozen Russian assets, but Belgium, where the vast bulk of the cash is held, demanded guarantees on sharing liability that proved too much for other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the deal, which he described as \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Writing on X, he said it was important for Russian assets to remain \"immobilised\" and said: \"Thank you for the result and for unity\".\n",

      "\n",
      "EU ⁠leaders avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\" ​with ‌their decision to provide Ukraine with a loan through borrowing cash rather than ​use frozen Russian assets, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De ​Wever said early on Friday.\n",

      "\"We remained united,\" De ‌Wever added. \n",

      "Meanwhile, Zelensky announced Ukrainian and US delegations would hold new talks on Friday and Saturday in the United States.\n",
